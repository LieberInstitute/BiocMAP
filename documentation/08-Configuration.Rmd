# Configuration {#configuration}

[INSERT PIPELINE NAME HERE] is designed to be highly customizable, yet need no configuration from a user wishing to rely on sensible default settings. Most configuration, including software settings, hardware resources such as memory and CPU use, and more, can be done in a single file determined [here](#your-config-file). Please note that the common, "major" [options](#command-opts) are specified in your [main script](#your-main-script), and not in the configuration file. The config is intended to hold the "finer details", which are documented below.

## Specifying Options for your Cluster

In many cases, a user has access to a computing cluster which they intend to run [INSERT PIPELINE NAME HERE] on. If your cluster is SLURM or SGE-based, the pipeline is pre-configured with options you may be used to specifying (such as disk usage, time for a job to run, etc). However, these are straightforward to modify, should there be a need/desire. Common settings are described in detail below; however, a more comprehensive list of settings from nextflow can be found [here](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#directives).

### Time

The maximum allowed run time for a process, or step in the pipeline, can be specified. This may be necessary for users who are charged based on run time for their jobs.

#### Default for all processes

The simplest change you may wish to make is to relax time constraints for all processes. The setting for this is here:

```{groovy, eval=FALSE}
executor {
    name = 'sge'
    queueSize = 40
    submitRateLimit = '1 sec'
    exitReadTimeout = '40 min'
}

process {
    cache = 'lenient'
    
    time = 10.hour  // this can be adjusted as needed
```

While the syntax is not strict, some examples for properly specifying the option are `time = '5m'`, `time = '2h'`, and `time = '1d'` (minutes, hours, and days, respectively).

#### Specify per-process

Time restrictions may also be specified for individual workflow steps. This can be done with the same syntax- suppose you wish to request 30 minutes for a given sample to be trimmed (note process names [here](#pipeline-overview)). In the "process" section of your config, find the section labelled "withName: Trimming" as in the example here:

```{groovy, eval=FALSE}
withName: Trimming {
    cpus = 1
    memory = 5.GB
    time = '30m' // specify a maximum run time of 30 minutes
}
```

### Cluster-specific options

In some cases, you may find it simpler to directly specify options accepted by your cluster. For example, SGE users with a default limit on the maximum file size they may directly adjust the "h_fsize" variable as below:

```{groovy, eval=FALSE}
withName: FilterAlignments {
    cpus = 2
    penv = 'local'
    memory = 16.GB
    clusterOptions = '-l h_fsize=800G'
}
```

As with the time option, this can be specified per-process or for all processes. Any option recognized by your cluster may be used.

## [INSERT PIPELINE NAME HERE] settings

A number of variables in your [config file](#your-config-file) exist to control choices about annotation to use, options passed to software tools, and more. These need not necessarily be changed, but allow more precise control over the pipeline if desired. Values for these variables may be changed in the "params" section of your config (near the top). A full descriptive list is provided below.

### Annotation settings

* *gencode_version_human*: the GENCODE release to use for default (non-custom) annotation, when "hg38" or "hg19" references are used. A string, such as "32".
* *gencode_version_mouse*: the GENCODE release to use for default (non-custom) annotation, when "mm10" reference is used. A string, such as "M23".
* *anno_build*: controls which sequences are used in analysis with default (non-custom) annotation. "main" indicates only canonical reference sequences; "primary" includes additional scaffolds.

### Arioc settings

Below, we document how the names of settings accepted by [INSERT PIPELINE NAME HERE] correspond to variables in Arioc configuration. For documentation on those Arioc configuration variables, see [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RWilton/Arioc/master/Arioc.guide.pdf).

* *batch_size*: this is passed to the "batchSize" attribute of the "AriocU" or "AriocP" element of the config for `AriocU` or `AriocP`.
* *gapped_seed*: this is passed to the "seed" attribute of the "gapped" element of the config for `AriocU` or `AriocP`.
* *nongapped_seed*: this is passed to the "seed" attribute of the "nongapped" of the config for `AriocU` or `AriocP`.
* *gapped_args*: these arguments in string form are passed literally to the "gapped" element of the config for `AriocU` or `AriocP`.
* *nongapped_args*: these arguments in string form are passed literally to the "nongapped" element of the config for `AriocU` or `AriocP`.
* *x_args*: these arguments in string form are passed literally to the "AriocU" or "AriocP" element of the config for `AriocU` or `AriocP`.
* *gpu_mask*: this is passed to the "gpuMask" attribute of the "AriocU" or "AriocP" element of the config for `AriocU` or `AriocP`.

### Miscellaneous settings

[TODO: BRIEF DESCRIPTION]

* *kallisto_single_args*: literal arguments to pass to 'kallisto quant' for single-end samples, as part of the process for estimating bisulfite conversion efficiency when using the '--with_lambda' [option](#command-opts).
