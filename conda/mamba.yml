#  Specification for a minimal conda environment, simply containing mamba. The
#  idea is to create an environment just "large" enough to use mamba (a faster
#  and more informative drop-in replacement for conda), then install the
#  remaining dependencies using mamba. See 'install_software.sh' for more
#  details.
dependencies:
